During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

Generally,it is a little difficult for me because there is too much accident that make me really confused.Fortunately, I finish it anyway.
